# Algorithms with Java 📚

Welcome to **Algorithms with Java**, a repository dedicated to solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems using Java. This repo is aimed at building strong problem-solving skills for coding interviews, competitive programming, and mastering algorithmic patterns.

## About

This repository contains clean, well-documented Java solutions for popular coding problems covering arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. The goal is to follow best practices and improve coding efficiency with every problem solved.

## Resources & Learning

The following learning resources are primarily used for problem selection and solution approaches:

- [NeetCode 150 Course by DestinationFAANG on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0u5nwSA0w0&t=288s) — Comprehensive video course covering key algorithms and data structures problems.
- LeetCode 75 — Curated list of 75 essential LeetCode problems covering fundamental topics.
- LeetCode Quests — Structured problem sets on LeetCode to master concepts progressively.
